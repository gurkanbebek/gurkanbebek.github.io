Writing block is real. I have personally experienced this multiple times during my academic career. While I tried multiple approaches to cope with this, I found one approach that was interesting and useful. (Also, in the title) Using a writing log can help you. It helped me for sure. 


What you do is simply keep a log of words you write per day. This motivates you to write something, and also get you started. Even if you type 100 words, just record it and see how you build up your writing. 


There are, of course, other approaches to tackle this. There is a great TED talk about how to end procrastination. I think the core idea is same here. Let's just get going and see the results.
