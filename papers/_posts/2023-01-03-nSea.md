Advances in molecular characterization have reshaped our understanding of low-grade
glioma (LGG) subtypes, emphasizing the need for comprehensive classification beyond histology. Leveraging
this, we present a novel approach, network-based Subnetwork Enumeration, and Analysis (nSEA),
to identify distinct LGG patient groups based on dysregulated molecular pathways. Using gene expression
profiles from 516 patients and a protein-protein interaction network we generated 25 million subnetworks.
Through our unsupervised bottom-up approach, we selected 92 subnetworks that categorized
LGG patients into five groups. Notably, a new LGG patient group with a lack of mutations in EGFR,
NF1, and PTEN emerged as a previously unidentified patient subgroup with unique clinical features
and subnetwork states. Validation of the patient groups on an independent dataset demonstrated the
robustness of our approach and revealed consistent survival traits across different patient populations.
This study offers a comprehensive molecular classification of LGG, providing insights beyond traditional
genetic markers. By integrating network analysis with patient clustering, we unveil a previously
overlooked patient subgroup with potential implications for prognosis and treatment strategies. Our
approach sheds light on the synergistic nature of driver genes and highlights the biological relevance of
the identified subnetworks. With broad implications for glioma research, our findings pave the way for
further investigations into the mechanistic underpinnings of LGG subtypes and their clinical relevance.
