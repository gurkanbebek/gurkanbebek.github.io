blurb: Ziyin is interested in single cell sequencing analysis. He matriculated in the BSTP PhD Program in the School of Medicine.
Full_Text:  Ziyin's work is on distinguish between early-stage and late-stage Alzheimer's disease. The proportion of immune cells vary in the CSF of AD patients, which could indicate alterations in the disease's immune environment, potentially impacting disease severity, progression, and response to treatment.

ase cannot be cured directly. However, if it can be diagnosed early, there will be greater room for intervention to alleviate the conditions of AD and dementia. As the best sample for predicting neuroinflammation, inflammation analytes in CSF can predict neuroinflammation in the brains of AD patients. However, current research knows very little about the role of immune cells in CSF in neuroinflammation. Also, as blood-driven leukocyte, certain cell types in CSF leukocyte, such as monocytes and NK cells, are not identical to those in plasma. Previous studies have been done on CSF leukocyte in AD. However, whether it can reflect the early stage of AD, especially the preclinical stage of AD, and how it evolves in each stage has not been fully studied. Therefore, we study the proportion of leukocyte cells at different stages by studying scRNAseq samples of CSF and how the genes are differentially expressed through the process of AD in each type of immune cell.
