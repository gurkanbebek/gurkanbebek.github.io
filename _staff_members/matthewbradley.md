blurb: I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (class of 2025). I am interested in pushing methodological boundaries in bioinformatics. I am chiefly interested in finding more meaningful ways to extract information from multi-Omic experiments. I am also a large proponent of finding new ways to be reproducible and collaborative within the burgeoning community of bioinformaticians. Beyond the school I work as a bioinformatics programmer for The Emmes Company, LLC where I am responsible for supporting a variety of projects including exploratory clinical trial research. My hobbies include snowboarding, hiking, guitar, and cooking to name a few. I also am learning to enjoy many of the fabulous restaurants in the greater Cleveland area!
