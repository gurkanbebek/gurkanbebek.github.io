				<h2 class="editable">Research on Cancer</h2>
				<p class="editable"> In Cancer, our goal is to stratify patients for better diagnosis and identifying possible drug targets to improve patient outcomes. 

We develop pan-cancer network biology algorithms that utilize data mining and machine learning approaches. Our goal is to integrate multiple datasets that describe tumors to maximize the information we can gather and provide solid answers to these questions. 

Our algorithms provide patient classifications that would help stratify patients, find drugs that would work together in specific cancer types, and help us develop better treatments for cancer patients to improve clinical care.

				<h2 class="editable">Research on Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
				<p class="editable">In Alzheimer’s Disease our goal is to identify key driver genes related to rapid cognitive decline in patients. 

We generate large scale system level measurements from AD patient samples and use algorithms that we develop in our lab to analyze these datasets. 

The findings will provide fundamental knowledge that can be used to develop treatments to stage and mitigate cognitive decline in AD and improve clinical care.

				<h2 class="editable">LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Method</h2>
				<p class="editable">The purpose of LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® is to change “lean backward meetings” to “lean forward meetings”, where the result is more participation, more insights surfaced, more engagement, and ultimately, more commitment and faster implementations.
<p>
					The LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® method (LSP) is a facilitated thinking, communication, and problem-solving technique for use with organizations, teams, and individuals. It draws on extensive research from the fields of business, organizational development, psychology, and learning, and is based on the concept of “hand knowledge.”
<p>					
					Gurkan Bebek is a trained LSP facilitator. See latest session facilitated by him</i>.
